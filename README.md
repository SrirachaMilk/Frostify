# Frostify

---

## Goal

Create a device that can take a design input from a user and "print" it onto a cookie/cake/pancake using frosting/icing. This can be done using a 3D printer having the machine read the design and move the frosting around on the cake. The plan is to use a syringe to extrude the frosting and have motors to force the frosting out of it. Along with this the design would be able to take G-Code or convert the design to G-Code and be able to change extrusion force and positioning for the design.Â 

### Secondary Goals

Be able to switch out colors
